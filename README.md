# Jal

## Preface
Jal is a UNCC BINF 6380 Advanced Programming project that challenges students to make a sufficiently complex programming project by the end of the semester. 

## About Jal
Jal is a text-based story adventure that integrates a GUI for increased interactivity and provides a finite amount of options for a user in each zone. The events are designed in a [deterministic finite automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton) (DFA) schema, and the game engine was developed in a [model-view-controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) (MVC) pattern.

## Running Jal
To start the game, run the Start file.
