Bitemark:~Its deep and jagged, with dried blood around the edges.
As I slowly regain consciousness, I feel a sense of confusion and disorientation. My mind is foggy, and I can't remember how I got here or what happened to me. I try to sit up, but I feel weak and dizzy, and I have to lie back down. I look around my room, trying to piece together what is happening to me, but everything is blurry and distorted. I can hear strange noises coming from outside, and I can feel the presence of something evil lurking nearby. I try to scream for help, but my voice is hoarse and barely audible. I am trapped, and I know that I am about to face another night of unimaginable torment.~inBed.jpg
"WAKE. UP." A voice in my head, screaming at me to wake up. It's a deep, guttural voice, filled with anger and malice. I try to ignore it, to block it out, but it only gets louder and more insistent.I open my eyes and jump from my bed only to see darkness all around me.
I slowly get to my feet, feeling disoriented and unsteady. I shuffle towards the bathroom, my mind still foggy. I need a glass of water, something to clear my head and help me regain my composure... I reach the bathroom and turn on the faucet, but nothing comes out. I try again, but still no water. Panic starts to rise in my chest.~sink.jpg
I look under my bed and see something shiny, glinting in the dim light. I'm not sure what it is, but I'm curious.~bed.jpg
I remember having a dream last night, about trying to escape from a locked door. In the dream, I was trapped in a small, dark room, with no windows or other exits. The only way out was through the door, but it was locked tight, no matter how hard I tried to open it.It was so real, so vivid, that it still feels like I'm trapped in that room. I can still feel the fear and desperation, like it's a living, breathing thing inside me.~theDoor.jpg
"IT ISNT YOUR IMAGINATION"~face2.jpg
To my surprise, it's a key. A small, silver key, with intricate designs etched into the metal. I don't recognize it – I've never seen it before. But for some reason, it feels familiar, like I've held it in my hand before.~0~key.jpg
Suddenly a scream breaks the night's silence, it feels like it is coming from everywhere at once, the air pressure rising with its volume. As my head feels like it is about to split open, my eyes shoot open as the windows begin to run red with blood~window.jpg
I find a small, sharp knife, with a curved blade and a black handle. I turn the knife over in my hands, feeling its sharp edge.As I hold the knife, I feel a sense of power and control. But at the same time, I can't shake the feeling that I'm being tricked, that the knife is not what it seems. I don't know who left it under my bed, or why.~1~knife.jpg

IT HAS ARRIVED~stairEntity.jpg
"OH WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE FUN TO HAVE"~2~face3.jpg
There, on my arm, is a bite mark. It's deep and jagged, with dried blood around the edges. It looks fresh, like it was just made.I can't guess where it came from – all I know is that it wasn't there before.~theBite.jpg
YOU SHOULD HAVE RAN FASTER~face2.jpg
"YOU WILL BE HERE FOREVER"~2
But then, I had a sudden realization. I was dreaming. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the key. It fit perfectly in the lock, and with a turn of my wrist, the door swung open. I stepped through, into a bright and beautiful world, away from the house that had haunted my nightterrors. GAME OVER - Thank You!~escape.jpg
